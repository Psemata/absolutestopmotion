# **Absolute Stop Motion – The AR Animation Lab**

🚀 **Absolute Stop Motion** is an interactive installation that merges the magic of **stop-motion animation** with **augmented reality (AR)**. This project allows users to create frame-by-frame animations by placing physical **cards** on a table, which are then scanned in real-time by a tablet to generate AR content. The result is a **seamless and intuitive stop-motion experience**, blending **physical interaction** with **digital creativity**.

## 🎥 **How It Works**
1. **Set up the scene** – Place **Character, Background, Action, or Effect** cards on the table.
2. **Scan in real-time** – The tablet detects the cards and displays AR elements corresponding to their position.
3. **Animate step by step** – Move the cards **frame by frame** while the system captures each movement.
4. **Generate the animation** – The software **compiles the frames** into a smooth stop-motion video.
5. **Apply effects & export** – Users can add filters (hand-drawn, pixel art, VHS) and **download or share** their animation instantly.

## 🛠 **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend:** Unity + ARKit (iOS) / ARCore (Android)
- **Backend:** Custom image recognition & motion tracking
- **Hardware:** Tablet (iPad / Android), printed NFC / QR-based cards
- **Processing:** OpenCV for card detection & frame-by-frame analysis
- **Output:** MP4 video export with creative filters

## 🃏 **Card System**
| **Card Type**  | **Function**  | **Examples**  |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 🎭 **Characters** | Adds animated figures | Human, animal, robot |
| 🏠 **Backgrounds** | Sets the scene | Forest, city, space |
| 🎬 **Actions** | Triggers movements | Jump, run, disappear |
| 🔊 **Sound Effects** | Adds audio layers | Footsteps, explosion |
| 🎇 **Visual FX** | Enhances visuals | Fire, rain, glow |

By combining different cards, users can create their own **unique AR-powered stop-motion story**.

## 🎨 **Why It Works**
✅ **Bridges traditional stop-motion & new media**
✅ **Accessible for all skill levels** – No prior animation experience needed
✅ **Hands-on creativity** – Encourages storytelling through tangible interaction
✅ **Instant feedback & sharing** – Users see their animation evolve in real-time
