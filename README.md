# **Absolute Stop Motion â€“ The AR Animation Lab**

ðŸš€ **Absolute Stop Motion** is an interactive installation that merges the magic of **stop-motion animation** with **augmented reality (AR)**. This project allows users to create frame-by-frame animations by placing physical **tokens** on a table, which are then scanned in real-time by a camera to generate AR content. The result is a **seamless and intuitive stop-motion experience**, blending **physical interaction** with **digital creativity**.

## ðŸŽ¥ **How It Works**

1. **Set up the scene** â€“ Place **Character** tokens on the table.
2. **Scan in real-time** â€“ The tablet detects the cards and displays AR characters corresponding to their position.
3. **Animate step by step** â€“ Move the tokens **frame by frame** while the system captures each movement.
4. **Generate the animation** â€“ The software **compiles the frames** into a stop-motion video.
5. **Re-enact famous scene** - The users then follow the steps described by the realtor assistant.
6. **Export your own animation** - At the end, the users can save their animations as a gif !
