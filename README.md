# absolutestopmotion
Absolute Stop Motion is an interactive installation that merges the magic of stop-motion animation with augmented reality (AR). This project allows users to create frame-by-frame animations by placing physical cards on a table, which are then scanned in real-time by a tablet to generate AR content.
